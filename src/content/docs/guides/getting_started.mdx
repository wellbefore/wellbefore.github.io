<Steps>
1. <strong>Download the app</strong> from the App Store or Google Play Store.

    <Aside type="caution" title="Android Status">iOS is the primary focus for development. After the iOS app is in a steady state, the Android version will be released.</Aside>

2. <strong>Set up data</strong> by sharing selected health data with WellBefore. It is reccommended to use a smartwatch with heart rate monitoring, as it will provide consistent and automatic data collection. You can choose which data WellBefore has access to, and you can revoke access at any time.

    For more information on the data that WellBefore uses, see the [Biometrics](/reference/biometrics/) page.

3. <strong>Start onboarding</strong> by taking measurements and answering questions about your health. This will help WellBefore learn about your body and how it reacts to different situations.
4. <strong>Use the app</strong> to track your symptoms and receive alerts when symptoms are expected to worsen. You can also use the app to view your health data and see how it changes over time.
